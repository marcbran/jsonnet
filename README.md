# Jsonnet

This repository hosts reusable Jsonnet packages prepared for easy integration in other projects.
Each package has been processed by inlining all its code into a single file.
Additionally, each output file has been placed onto a separate branch.
This enables lightweight and straightforward usage with the [jsonnet-bundler](https://github.com/jsonnet-bundler/jsonnet-bundler).
